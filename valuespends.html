                        <p>This school project reflects my passion for minimalist lifestyle and demonstrates how I adopted this mindset in my design approach. I believe that owning fewer non-essential items frees up time, money, and energy for things that
                            truly matter. With this in mind, I designed an app that assists users in setting meaningful goals and compares the value of money to other important things, such as working hours or a dream vacation. By using the app, users
                            gain a deeper understanding of the true value of their money, making it easier for them to avoid impulse buying and prioritise what's truly important to them.</p>

                        <p>By exploring the concept of a minimalist lifestyle, examining the phenomenon of impulse buying, and investigating its underlying causes, I aim to discover the potential benefits of a minimalist lifestyle in curbing impulsive spending

                    <div class="text-container">
                        <p><strong>Goal:</strong> The goal of the interview is to gain a deeper understanding of how individuals react to and feel about impulse buying. Specifically, I aim to explore their approaches to dealing with impulsive purchases,
                            such as how they define an impulse buy and what strategies they use to prevent it. </p>
                        <p>Additionally, I seek to discover how people's goals and values relate to their spending habits. Are their goals aligned with their values, and how do these factors influence their buying decisions?</p>
                        <p><strong>Method:</strong> To achieve these objectives, I conducted in-person interviews with eight participants from diverse countries, ranging in age from 19 to 45. I created an interview script consisting of 20 open-ended questions
                            that focused on exploring the participants' values, motivations, and approaches to curbing impulsive buying behaviours. Using the transcription app Otter, I recorded the interviews and then listened to them again after all
                            the interviews were completed. I then used the online tool Miro to organise and analyse the responses.</p>

                        <p>To create low-fidelity prototypes, I used Figma to translate my sketches into digital designs. The app consists of three primary screens: the GOAL page, the ANALYZE page, and the HOLD page.</p>

                            <li>The GOAL page is designed to assist users in setting meaningful and valuable financial goals. Additionally, this page provides users with an overview of their overall financial situation.</li>
                            <li>The ANALYZE page allows users to input the amount of money they plan to spend on impulse-buying items. The app then provides a series of analyzed data to assist users in determining whether the purchase is worth the expense.</li>
                            <li>The HOLD page encourages users to delay making impulsive purchases in order to reduce the frequency of such purchases.</li>

                        <p>After creating the low-fidelity prototypes, I conducted user testing to evaluate their effectiveness. The goal was to assess how easily users could comprehend each screen without any explanation. Based on the user testing results,
                            I made several improvements to the design.</p>
                        <p>Here are the key results from the user testing that informed my design improvements:</p>

                        <p><strong>To avoid overwhelming the user, reduce the amount of information displayed on the screen and only shows the essential details the user desires to see.</strong></p>
                        <p>On the goal page, only available spending is displayed, as this is what users are most interested in. However, during user testing, one participant preferred the option to hide financial details, expressing concern about privacy
                            while using the app in public places.</p>

                        <p>I used three diagrams to translate the idea of money into the number of working hours, the amount of time to save, and the negative number of the personalised impulse purchase on the goal page’s section titled “Valuable Goals.”
                            Without explanation, the user could find the statistics confusing.</p>

                        <p>To improve user understanding, I changed the terminology on the Hold page from Hold to Waitlist, which makes it more evident that users need to wait before making a purchase. On the "Add New Valuable Goal" page, I simplified the
                            language to enhance user comprehension. I also restructured the table content, dividing it into logical groups and adding headings to visually differentiate the sections. This makes it easier for users to locate specific items
                            in the table, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>

                        <p>To ensure visual consistency and coherence, I leveraged the design system. This system involved the creation of a set of standardised components, such as buttons, fonts, colours, and layout guidelines. These elements work harmoniously

                        <p>After addressing the usability issues, I proceeded to craft high-fidelity prototypes using Figma. For the design approach, I embraced neumorphism, also known as soft UI design, which leverages background colours, shapes, gradients,
                            highlights, and shadows to achieve a subtle 3D effect, thus fostering a clean and minimalist aesthetic.</p>

                            <p>During this school passion project, I gained valuable experience in conducting interviews as part of the research process, and uncovered unexpected insights. <strong>It is important to plan your interview questions and use open-ended
                                questions to allow the interviewee to reveal their inner thoughts.</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>Never assume the user would understand even though you think it is a very obvious design.</strong> So user testing is an essential part of the design process, and I constantly asked for feedback from my peers and lecturers
                                to assist me in improving the design in terms of usability.</p>

                                <li>Improve the user experience for manual input of data.</li>
