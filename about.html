                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>I'm Yu Zhao, originally from China and currently residing in Auckland, New Zealand. I recently graduated from Media Design School with a Bachelor's degree in Interactive Design.</p>
                    <p>As a designer, my philosophy revolves around understanding people's daily thoughts, emotions, and behaviours, and leveraging that knowledge to create human-centred designs that enhance their lives on a daily basis.</p>
                    <p>My skill set covers a variety of areas related to UX / UI design such as user research, wireframes, prototypes, user testing and interaction design. I like to extract creative solutions to enhance users’ experiences through design
                        thinking.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-text">When I'm not designing, you can find me bouldering in the gym or climbing mountains. Climbing challenges me to think creatively and find unique solutions to overcome obstacles. It's a fun and rewarding way to stay active and push my
                        limits.

                        <p>I believe that everyone has the potential to learn and grow, regardless of their background, experiences, or abilities.
                        </p>
                        <p>By adopting a growth mindset, I am always seeking out new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. </p>
                        <p>I believe that it is essential to approach life with a sense of curiosity and a willingness to try new things, even if it means making mistakes along the way.</p>

                    <div class="text-container">
                        <p>Living in a diverse city like Auckland has taught me the importance of valuing different cultures and treating everyone with kindness and respect. </p>
                        <p>I believe that no matter who you are or where you come from, everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and compassion.</p>

                        <p>I truly believe that sticking with something and not giving up is the key to success in anything we do. No matter what the task, if we keep at it, we'll eventually make progress and reach our goals. </p>
                        <p>When I face failure, I see it as a chance to learn and grow, rather than a reason to quit. I realise that if I don't get the outcome I want, it's not because the goal is impossible, but because I need to put in more effort or try
                            a different approach.</p>
