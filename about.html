                <h1 class="hover-this">Hi there! Nice to e-meet you!</h1>
                <p>My name is Yu Zhao and I am currently in my final year of pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Interactive Design at <a class="highlight" href="https://www.mediadesignschool.com/" target=”_blank”>Media Design School</a>, with an expected graduation
                    date of November 2023.</p>
                <p>As a designer, my philosophy revolves around understanding people's daily thoughts, emotions, and behaviours, and leveraging that knowledge to create human-centred designs that enhance their lives on a daily basis.</p>
                <p>My skill set covers a variety of areas related to UX / UI design such as user research, wireframes, prototypes, user testing and interaction design. I like to extract creative solutions to enhance users’ experiences through design thinking.</p>
                <p>Although I don't have much industry experience yet, I'm eager to learn and grow as a designer. <strong>I'm seeking entry-level opportunities in UI/UX design</strong> where I can apply my skills and creativity to solve complex design challenges
                    and create meaningful user experiences.</p>
                <p>When I'm not designing, you can find me bouldering in the gym or climbing mountains. Climbing challenges me to think creatively and find unique solutions to overcome obstacles. It's a fun and rewarding way to stay active and push my limits.</p>

                <h4 class="hover-this">Embracing a Growth Mindset</h4>
                <p>I believe that everyone has the potential to learn and grow, regardless of their background, experiences, or abilities. By adopting a growth mindset, I am always seeking out new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.
                    I believe that it is essential to approach life with a sense of curiosity and a willingness to try new things, even if it means making mistakes along the way.

            <div class="value_list">
                <h4 class="hover-this">Respecting Others & Staying Humble</h4>
                <p>Living in a diverse city like Auckland has taught me the importance of valuing different cultures and treating everyone with kindness and respect. I believe that no matter who you are or where you come from, everyone deserves to be treated
                    with dignity and compassion.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="value_list">
                <h4 class="hover-this">Persistence is victory</h4>
                <p>I truly believe that sticking with something and not giving up is the key to success in anything we do. No matter what the task, if we keep at it, we'll eventually make progress and reach our goals. When I face failure, I see it as a chance
                    to learn and grow, rather than a reason to quit. I realise that if I don't get the outcome I want, it's not because the goal is impossible, but because I need to put in more effort or try a different approach.</p>
