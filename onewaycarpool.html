            <h1 class="text_purple">OVERVIEW</h1>
            <p>With the ever-increasing petrol prices in New Zealand and the heavy traffic on the roads, commuters are looking for ways to cut down on transportation costs and contribute to environmental sustainability. Carpooling emerges as an ideal solution
                to these challenges. Oneway carpool provides a user-friendly platform that enables individuals to quickly and conveniently locate and connect with like-minded individuals who are also interested in carpooling, whether for regular daily
                commutes or one-off trips.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="casestudy_text_section">
            <h1 class="text_purple">PROBLEM</h1>
            <p>Many commuters face the dual challenges of high petrol prices and long wait times for public transportation, making it difficult to find an affordable and efficient way to get to their destinations. As a result, there is a growing need for
                a transportation solution that addresses both of these issues, allowing commuters to reduce their transportation costs while also minimizing their wait times. By providing a more accessible and convenient way to travel, this solution could
                greatly improve the overall commuting experience for many individuals.</p>
            <p><strong>"How might we provide a transportation solution that not only helps commuters save money in the
                    face of rising petrol prices but also reduces wait times associated with traditional public
                    transportation, ultimately enabling a more convenient and efficient commuting experience?"</strong>

        </div>

        <div class="casestudy_text_section">
            <h1 class="text_purple">SOLUTION</h1>
            <p>With the Oneway Carpool app, users can efficiently locate and connect with compatible carpool partners along their daily route, thereby reducing their transportation costs and commute times while also minimising their carbon footprint. Through
                the use of T2 and T3 transit lanes, Oneway Carpool optimises travel time and reduces traffic congestion, contributing to a more efficient and eco-friendly commuting experience. Overall, Oneway Carpool offers a simple and accessible solution
                for individuals looking to save money, time, and contribute to a more sustainable transportation system.

            <h1 class="text_purple">RESEARCH</h1>
            <p>To begin, I conducted online research to examine the current state of carpooling in New Zealand, as well as other ride-sharing platforms currently available. The following are key findings:</p>
            <ul class="ul_list">
                <li>Every day, 1.4 million Kiwis drive to work, with the majority traveling alone. This leaves 5.5 million empty seats out of a total of 7 million seats available, indicating a significant potential carpooling market.</li>
                <li>Only 37% of individuals aged 15 and above in New Zealand have utilized public transportation within the past year, and wait times can be lengthy.</li>
                <li>While well-known ride-sharing applications such as Uber, Zoomy, and DiDi are available in New Zealand, they are costly. Additionally, there are some free ride-sharing platforms, but they can have confusing user interfaces.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="more_space_top">With these findings in mind, I aim to develop an app that takes advantage of carpooling while remaining affordable for users. The goal of this app is to provide a platform for both drivers and riders to save money rather than earn money.</p>

            <p>During the usability testing, I first asked the users about their experience using ride-sharing apps and briefly introduced them to the oneway carpool app. I then gave them specific tasks to perform, such as posting a ride as a driver and
                finding a driver to book a ride with, and asked them to find their pending trips and use the app's chat function. I observed how users interacted with the app and listened to their feedback to determine whether the lo-fi prototype was
                effective in communicating the app's basic features and functionality.</p>
            <p>Based on the feedback from the usability testing, the users were able to complete the tasks and understand the user flow. This indicates that the lo-fi prototype was successful in communicating the app's basic features and functionality.</p>

            <h1 class="text_purple">HIGH-FIDELITY PROTOTYPES</h1>
            <p>After conducting user testing on the low-fidelity prototype, I used the feedback gathered to create high-fidelity prototypes. These prototypes provided a more detailed and polished version of the ride-sharing app's user interface, and were
                developed using design software Figma.</p>
            <p>Given that the driver and rider have different needs and user flows, I created two main user flows:
                <strong>one for drivers on how to post a ride,</strong> and <strong>another for riders on how to find a
                    ride.</strong> I made sure that each flow was tailored to the specific needs of each user type, providing a seamless and intuitive experience.
            </p>
            <p>To showcase the high-fidelity prototypes, an interactive prototype is available for viewing below. This prototype allows users to interact with the app as if it were a fully functioning product, giving them a better sense of how the app would
                look and feel in use.</p>

            <p>Through this project, I learned that the design process requires iteration and may involve going back and forth several times before finding the right solution. And User research and testing are crucial for improving the design's usability
                and accessibility.</p>
            <div>
                <p>If I had more time to improve this project, some next steps would be:</p>
                <ul class="ul_list">
                    <li>Differentiate the interface more clearly for the rider and driver to avoid confusion.</li>
                    <li>Explore how the interface could look when the driver is in the process of picking up riders.</li>
                    <li>Research how users would prefer to make payments to share costs.</li>
