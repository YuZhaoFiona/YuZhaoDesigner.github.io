            <h1 class="text_red">ABOUT THE PROJECT</h1>
            <p>A team of 5 members collaborated to rebrand and redesign the PASC website, with a focus on improving accessibility, usability, and the overall user experience. As the website designer, my primary responsibility was to lead the redesign efforts
                and create a new membership section while incorporating the new rebranding system into the interface design.</p>
            <p>Throughout the six-week project, we worked both independently and as a team to ensure consistency and progress towards our goals. We presented our progress to the clients three times, receiving constructive feedback that we used to refine
                our designs.</p>
            <p>At the end of the project, our team received an A+ for our final output, which was a testament to our dedication and hard work in delivering a high-quality product. It was my first experience collaborating with others on a project, and I learned
                valuable lessons on teamwork, communication, and the importance of incorporating feedback into the design process.</p>

        <div class="casestudy_text_section">
            <h1 class="text_red">PASC BRIEF</h1>
            <p>The Pan-Asian Screen Collective (P-ASC) launched in August 2018 to represent, provide advocacy and facilitate opportunities for Pan-Asian screen practitioners on and behind New Zealand’s screens.</p>
            <ul class="ul_list">
                <li>PASC branding: Does PASC need a new branding that better represent our membership base/demographic and potentially a special 5th anniversary brand/logo that we can use to create special 5th anniversary merchandise for our members to purchase?</li>
                <li>We are potentially looking to move towards paid membership model next year as part of the 5th anniversary, similar to other organizations with a membership model, what could a new membership pack and promotion to attract new members look
                    like for PASC?</li>
                <li>We are about to launch a new website and currently reviewing our social media channels to better engage with our members across Aotearoa. Could there be an opportunity to revamp our digital channels and maybe attached with that the branding?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="casestudy_text_section">
            <h1 class="text_red">THE CHALLENGE</h1>
            <p>Firstly, its visual system was outdated, cluttered, and lacked any sense of excitement or modernity. The navigation system was confusing and difficult to follow, leading to a poor user experience. </p>
            <p>Secondly, the core offerings of PASC were not clearly emphasised, making it difficult for users to understand what the organisation does and what it has to offer.</p>
            <p>Finally, some pages were left empty, which could disappoint users and make them question the organisation's reliability and credibility.</p>
        </div>

            <h1 class="text_red more_space_bottom">WEBSITE REDESIGN</h1>
            <h2 class="text_red">Current website analysis:</h2>
            <p>To redesign the PASC website, I conducted an analysis of the current website to identify areas for improvement to address business and user needs. I discovered several issues that could potentially discourage users from using the website:</p>
            <ul class="ul_list">
                <li>The Instagram and Facebook icons are too small, and the search bar sometimes fails to show results, which may frustrate users.</li>
                <li>The logo takes up a significant portion of the header space, potentially detracting from other important content.</li>
                <li>The navigation bar contains a lot of content, which may overwhelm users if presented at the beginning.</li>
                <li>The upcoming events section is empty but still displays the title, which could confuse users.</li>
                <li>The footer only displays the logo with a few links, which doesn't provide much interaction with users, wasting valuable space.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text_red more_space_top">Design goals:</h2>
            <p>With these issues in mind, We established several design goals to guide the redesign process:</p>
            <ul class="ul_list">
                <li>Embody the core characteristics of PASC throughout all components of their visual design system.</li>
                <li>Clearly emphasise the membership section and mission statement on the home page.</li>
                <li>Reflect, uplift and re-frame are the keywords to define the PASC mission. These keywords have physical traits as well as more metaphorical meanings.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text_red more_space_top">Original vs. Redesigned PASC Website:</h2>
            <p class="space_bottom_20">To evaluate the changes, it would be helpful to view the original PASC website alongside the redesigned version.</p>

            <p>P-ASC's new website is fully aligned with the new brand identity. Upon entering the website, users are greeted with an animated brand identity, which not only helps them to understand the P-ASC brand but also emphasises the importance of moving
                images. The main page features five sections, including NEWS, EVENTS, MEMBERSHIP, MEMBER SPOTLIGHT, and EPISODE ONE.</p>
            <p>To accommodate PASC's upcoming paid membership plan, we added a dedicated membership section that highlights the various pricing plans and associated benefits. Additionally, we added a new section called Member Spotlight, featuring reviews
                from current members. This provides an excellent opportunity to showcase PASC and encourage more people to sign up.</p>

            <p>This project was a precious learning experience for me in so many ways. In six weeks, our team completed all of the tasks that had been assigned to us. I learnt a lot about the design process, collaboration, and how to balance my design choices
                with the opinions of others. Here are two key takeaways that will benefit my ongoing studies and career:</p>

            <p><strong>1 Understanding how to collaborate is critical.</strong><br> While I had previous experience working in teams and communicating with all kinds of individuals, this was my first time working with designers from various multidisciplinary
                fields. I had to learn to be more conscious and receptive to critical feedback, as well as how to adapt to the habits and methodologies of other designers.</p>
            <p><strong>2 As UI/UX designers, learning to code may help us understand what is possible within a product.</strong><br>As a UI/UX designer and developer in this team, I started to understand that knowing coding can help me communicate better
                with developers and have an understanding of what's possible and how to implement it. This project has helped me to gain new collaboration skills that will be useful for future projects.
