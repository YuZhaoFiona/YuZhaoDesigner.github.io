                        <p>As a passionate rock climber, this project's origin stems from my personal experiences when I travelled to other countries. I often desired to engage in outdoor climbing, but found myself without my climbing gear, unfamiliar with
                            local climbing spots, and lacking a climbing partner. That's when it struck me – there has to be a better way for climbers like me to enjoy the sport, even when far from home.</p>
                        <p>This project aims to address these challenges by developing 'Cragging Day,' an innovative app that bridges the gap between travelling climbers and local enthusiasts, enabling the seamless exchange of gear, local climbing knowledge,
                            and cultural experiences. </p>

                        <p>To validate that the problem isn't just a personal problem but exists among climbers, I conducted a survey to prove that. Based on the input of 30 participants, a striking 80% indicated that they include climbing in their travel
                            plans. Moreover, 70% of climbers engage in climbing multiple times per week, underscoring the strong desire to explore climbing spots while travelling. Additionally, 80% of respondents fell within the 25 to 35 age group, highlighting
                            a key demographic. Through this survey, I also identified three main challenges that climbers face while travelling.</p>

                        <p>I interviewed six experienced climbers to gain insights into the challenges faced by both traveling and local climbers. The interviews were structured around three key research questions: 1, Understanding the challenges of 25-35-year-old
                            rock climbers when exploring new locations during travel. 2, Exploring difficulties in local climbers partnering with individuals from different places. 3, How to create reliable connections between travellers and local climbers.</p>
                        <p>To capture the nuances of the conversations, I used Otter to record and transcribe the interviews. This method allowed for a detailed analysis of participants' responses, providing a foundation for the subsequent design process.</p>

                        <p>To maintain design consistency, I created a comprehensive design system with reusable components.  I opted for the DM Sans typefaces, chosen for their excellent readability and modern, clean aesthetics. The utilisation of various
                            font sizes and weights helped create a distinct hierarchy within the design. The brand colours—green, yellow, and white—were selected to evoke a sense of youth, energy, and fun, aligning with the exhilarating and dynamic nature
                            of rock climbing. Additionally, I adhered to a 4-pixel-based spacing approach, ensuring precise hierarchy and visual balance across the entire app.</p>
                        <p> The brand name is Cragging Day. "Cragging" is a term commonly used in the climbing community to refer to the activity of climbing at a crag. It clearly communicates the focus on cragging and suggests a platform or community where
                            climbers can plan or connect for a day of climbing. It's approachable and easy to remember. The logo combines the letter 'C' with a mountain shape, creating a bold and fun symbol.</p>

                            <p>Reflecting on this four-month project, I can't help but marvel at how much I've learned and how my problem-solving skills have transformed. <strong>The big 'Aha!' moment for me came when I was trying to figure out how to differentiate
                                between traveling and local climbers.</strong> Instead of asking users to label themselves, I thought, "Why not just look at their familiarity with climbing spots?" That simple shift made everything crystal clear and greatly
                                improved the user experience.</p>
                            <p>Another thing I've learned is <strong>the incredible value of fresh perspectives.</strong> When you're knee-deep in a project, you can't always see the forest for the trees. Getting fresh eyes to look at your project always
                                can provide valuable insight you might have missed.</p>
                            <p>Looking to the future, while this project has reached its conclusion as part of my university degree, it is the beginning of a new adventure for me. I'm considering working on it as a side project and collaborating with my
                                partner, who's a developer. Our goal is to refine and potentially release it. Given our limited resources, we might start small, focusing on the Auckland climbing community, so I will need to refine the user flow and keep
                                it simple and manageable. Constantly testing with climbers and ensuring an intuitive user experience. This will also serve as excellent practice for me as I step into the industry.</p>
