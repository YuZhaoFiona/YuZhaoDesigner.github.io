                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>As a passionate rock climber, this project's origin stems from my personal experiences when I travelled to other countries. I often desired to engage in outdoor climbing, but found myself without my climbing gear, unfamiliar with local
                        climbing spots, and lacking a climbing partner. That's when it struck me – there has to be a better way for climbers like me to enjoy the sport, even when far from home.</p>
                    <p>This project aims to address these challenges by developing 'Cragging Day,' an innovative app that bridges the gap between travelling climbers and local enthusiasts, enabling the seamless exchange of gear, local climbing knowledge,
                        and cultural experiences. </p>

                    <p><strong>Passionate rock climbers</strong> who want to enjoy climbing <strong>while travelling</strong> face problems like <strong>carrying heavy gear, not knowing good climbing spots, and not finding climbing partners.</strong> These
                        challenges make it hard for them to have great climbing experiences during their trips.</p>

                    <p>Cragging Day revolutionises the climbing experience by offering a comprehensive solution to the challenges faced by climbers. Through intuitive interfaces, the app enables users to seamlessly explore climbing opportunities based on
                        their location and availability. The climber filtering feature ensures climbers find compatible companions, while the communication hub facilitates easy planning and sharing of climbing adventures. With a reference system enhancing
                        safety, Cragging Day empowers climbers to connect, explore, and contribute to the creation of a thriving global climbing community.</p>

                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>To validate that the problem isn't just a personal problem but exists among climbers, I conducted a survey to prove that. Based on the input of 30 participants, a striking 80% indicated that they include climbing in their travel plans.
                        Moreover, 70% of climbers engage in climbing multiple times per week, underscoring the strong desire to explore climbing spots while travelling. Additionally, 80% of respondents fell within the 25 to 35 age group, highlighting
                        a key demographic. Through this survey, I also identified three main challenges that climbers face while travelling.</p>

                    <p>I interviewed six experienced climbers to gain insights into the challenges faced by both traveling and local climbers. The interviews were structured around three key research questions: 1, Understanding the challenges of 25-35-year-old
                        rock climbers when exploring new locations during travel. 2, Exploring difficulties in local climbers partnering with individuals from different places. 3, How to create reliable connections between travellers and local climbers.</p>
                    <p>To capture the nuances of the conversations, I used Otter to record and transcribe the interviews. This method allowed for a detailed analysis of participants' responses, providing a foundation for the subsequent design process.</p>

                    <div class="text-container">
                        <p>Reflecting on this four-month project, I can't help but marvel at how much I've learned and how my problem-solving skills have transformed. The big 'Aha!' moment for me came when I was trying to figure out how to differentiate
                            between traveling and local climbers. Instead of asking users to label themselves, I thought, "Why not just look at their familiarity with climbing spots?" That simple shift made everything crystal clear and greatly improved
                            the user experience.</p>
                        <p>Another thing I've learned is the incredible value of fresh perspectives. When you're knee-deep in a project, you can't always see the forest for the trees. Getting fresh eyes to look at your project always can provide valuable
                            insight you might have missed.</p>
                        <p>Looking to the future, while this project has reached its conclusion as part of my university degree, it is the beginning of a new adventure for me. I'm considering working on it as a side project and collaborating with my partner,
                            who's a developer. Our goal is to refine and potentially release it. Given our limited resources, we might start small, focusing on the Auckland climbing community, so I will need to refine the user flow and keep it simple
                            and manageable. Constantly testing with climbers and ensuring an intuitive user experience. This will also serve as excellent practice for me as I step into the industry.</p>
